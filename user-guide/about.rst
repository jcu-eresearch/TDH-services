Mediaflux
----------

Mediaflux is a system used to store research data at JCU.
The system extracts metadata from your data. Metadata is data describing your data.
Metadata can make your data searchable and thus more useable.

We use Mediaflux to provide several different access mechanisms to your data.

* The "Desktop" is a website for accessing and storing your data.
* "Portals" functionality allows sharing of your data using a pre defined web layout.
* "SFTP" secure file transfer protocol has been setup for easy access using SFTP clients such as FileZilla.
* "Mediaflux Explorer" is a java program for managing your data. It has reduced functionality of the "Desktop" but is easier to use. This is ideal for most users.

Help documentation is available within the Mediaflux Desktop.

Aspera Shares
-------------

Aspera Shares is a web based service for accessing research data storage at JCU.
This system can provide high speed access to your data storage.

Research Data
-------------

Research Data is used to expose your data. Like a library catalogue entry but for research data.
The system allows researchers to request a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for the record. Research Data exposure
is increased via Research Data Australia - https://researchdata.ands.org.au/. If you have an entry on
the JCU Research Portfolio - https://jcu.me any records will be displayed via a 'Data' tab.
Many publishers are now requiring exposure of completed datasets, Research Data is the system to do this.
You can choose how exposed your data is by selecting a suitable license and specifying the access rights.
